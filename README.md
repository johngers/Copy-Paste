This app is a cross platform app built with Flutter which is a library built with the programming lanaguage Dart

In order to actually run our app yourself, you would have to set up the API keys from Firebase on each individual platform

If you have the Flutter SDK and properly set up the Firebase API keys, you can just replace the main.dart file in your Flutter project.

This project can't be fully uploaded to github because it exposes the API keys we used for our project.
